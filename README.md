# National Park Weather Service

This project is a website built using Spring MVC. It is a Weather service website for National parks, and also contains information about each national park. It contains integration tests and JUnit tests. The task involved creating a page with viewable pictures of national parks. Users of the system were to be able to select a park to view additional details. In addition, users were to be able to view the weather forecast for each of the parks, with recommendations for how to dress based on certain weather criteria. In viewing the forecasts, the user was to be able to choose between their preference of Celsius or Fahrenheit. Finally, a user was to be able to participate in a daily survey, linking to a page that shows the top parks according to votes, if a park has received any votes.

**What I Learned**

This project required me to learn in full the model-view-controller software design pattern, and using Spring MVC for this project was a great learning experience for working with controllers, components, and mapping. I learned about running Tomcat and using servlets, made use of getmapping, postmapping, and validation, and overall got a much greater understanding of how mapping works in Java. This project also gave me a chance to write a lot of code in HTML and CSS, as well as a lot of practice with using and formatting Bootstrap CSS.
